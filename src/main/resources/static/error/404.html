  <h3>404 Not Found</h3>
  <p>
    The server can not find the requested resource.<br/>
    In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized.<br/>
    In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist.<br/>
    Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client.<br/>
    This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web.
